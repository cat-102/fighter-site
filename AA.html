Operational Notes
Daylight / clear-weather system — no search or tracking radar; relied on optical aiming.
Provided low-altitude cover for Soviet & Warsaw-Pact regimental units.
Vulnerable to countermeasures (flares, bad weather, night).
Superseded in the late 1970s–80s by 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 “Gopher”), which added better seeker & tracking.
